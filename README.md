### Description

A website showcasing a new co-working startup space. This site is meant to showcase this company's unique and exciting work environment. Here are the client's exact words for what they would like for their final product:

* "We just finished remodeling our space. We're really proud of it. We want our online presence to mirror our in-person presence, to attract people that would really enjoy working in our environment."
* "We want our space--no, our whole company--to feel a little luxurious, cool, and high-end; yet still 100% welcoming and inclusive to everyone. A safe, comfortable, and productive work environment, you know?"
* "I also think it's really important convey our unique personality. It's what sets us apart from the 'big guys' in the field. You know, places like WeWork and TechSpace. We think we're more funky, more local, less corporate, and a little more fun."
* "We want to avoid catering solely to tech. You walk into some of these other coworking spaces, and you only ever see people working on code. That's great, but we'd also love to see artists, daytraders, craftspeople, writers, counselors, more traditional business people--you know, anyone and everyone--in our space."
* "Our site should also show what amenities we have. We have an on-site coffee counter, both communal working areas and private offices, high-speed internet, printing and faxing services, and we usually have a fun, optional activity on Thursday afternoons. Like yoga, maybe a fun complementary food, or like...I don't know, maybe even crafts sometimes (come make your own mini desktop terrarium)?"

To start out, there are three user personas that are being kept in mind, inspired by the client's inclusive target users: Madison, a roaster at Stumptown Coffee who is also interested in Marketing, Charlie, an young but established software engineer looking for a more inspiring workspace that still has everything he needs to continue to further his career on his own terms, and Allessandra, a fine artist who has recently began to sell her artwork.

### User Stories

* As a craftsperson and specialty coffee roaster, I want a clean, easy to use interface he can explore all possible features of this new workspace.
* As a software developer, I want an exciting site, without bugs, that inspires my creativity so that I can be constantly motivated to continue producing fresh content.
* As a fine artist, I want a site that reflects on my passion and eye for beauty, so that potential clients can tell that I am fully invested in my art, start-to-finish.
